Purpose of the project:
1. Solve a practical problem with Shanling M0s
2. Learn python and do the project the pythonic way (coming from C and Java)

The practical problem:
1. Does not sort
2. double entries do not always work

The POC version:
1. Creates a new playlist that:
   2. Is sorted
   3. Has no duplicates

Future versions will:
1. Handle errors
2. Use system arguments to input the m3u file
3. Be more "portable"
